# gitlab-pipeline
Hi
In this repository I have provided the Complete CI Pipeline for Java based application Build.
In this Pipeline we have used Docker Executor Gitlab Runner with base Image as Ubuntu:latest.
Gitlab Runner is running on Ubuntu 22.04 with Docker Installed on it.

Also the Pipeline is Configured to use some Group Variables and Project variables.
In the Group Variable We have defined the Container Registry URL and on Project Variable we have defined the Image Name.
